# Building-Conway-s-Game-of-Life-in-Python-Project
invented by mathematician John Horton Conway, is a cellular automaton that evolves based on an initial state and predefined rules. The simulation demonstrates complex behaviors arising from simple rules, making it a fascinating study in emergence and complexity.
